Building on the work done for the [2010 World Cup Bracket](../../world-cup-brackets/2010.html), I've used the same basic data visualization to build a bracket competition for everyone in our house.
Each of the four roommates submitted a bracket at the end of group play, and points are awarded for correct guesses.
The page is updated with the latest results each day.

While in this case the tournament results are stored statically in the javascript file, you could easily pull the results from an external data source in order to automatically update the standings.

Kelly's bracket may or may not have been completely made up without her input.
