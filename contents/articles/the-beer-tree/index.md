### Update: 2014-07-11

We've kicked one 1/4 barrel keg of [Stranger Pale Ale](http://lefthandbrewing.com/beers/stranger-pale-ale/), and are about to start in on a 1/6 barrel keg of [White Rascal](http://averybrewing.com/our-ales/white-rascal/).
We've been having what we believe were leaking issues with our CO<sub>2</sub> regulator, so we got that replaced yesterday.
